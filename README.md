# restaurant_sales_analysis

In this SQL project, I've optimized the Pizza Sales dataset for enhanced analysis using SQL queries ranging from intermediate to advanced levels.

The Pizza Sales data was initially available in an Excel format. I imported this data into MS-SQL Server and set up a database on my local system.

I employed various SQL data cleaning methods on the imported table, utilizing string functions, date functions, and more, leading to effective results.
