# restaurant_sales_analysis

In this SQL project, the primary focus was on the Pizza Sales dataset. This dataset, initially available in an Excel format, was imported into MYSQL Workbench for querying and analysis. A new database was created on my local system to house this data.
The Pizza Sales dataset includes various tables such as pizzas, order_details, orders, etc., each containing different aspects of pizza sales information. However, before any analysis could be performed, it was necessary to clean and optimize the data.

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. It involves preparing the data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted. This process can involve numerous techniques, and in this project, I used SQLâ€™s string functions and date functions among others.

By applying these functions and other data cleaning techniques, I was able to refine the Pizza Sales dataset and prepare it for effective analysis. The cleaned dataset now allows for more accurate insights to be drawn from it, ultimately leading to more informed decision-making.
